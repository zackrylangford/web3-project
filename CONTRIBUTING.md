So,if you would like to be the first person to contribute to this project, that is awesome. I will try to think of a cool reward or title for you :) 

Here are some steps: 

1. Read through our README.md and get an idea of what we are about. 

2. Head over to the Discussions tab to introduce yourself. 

3. We are currently in the research and development phase of the project, so we are brainstorming ideas. Submit your ideas and start
conversations in the idea thread of the discussion page. 

4. Thanks for taking your time to contribute!
