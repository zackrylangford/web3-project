# web3-project

It is June 8th, 2022 and the project is starting.....NOW. 

This is the first file that I have created for this project. 

I do not have a specific idea in mind for the project, I simply want to build something on Web3. 

It could be an app, game, or anything interesting. 

I am open to collaborating with anyone who is interested. 

My goal is to build something helpful to people. 

I know that is really open ended and does not sound very visionary, but it's where I'm at right now. 



To helping people, 

Zack Langford.
